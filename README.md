What is the Recommendation System?
A machine learning algorithm that uses big data to suggest products to users

Types:-

1 - Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on the preferences of users who are similar to the target user or items that are similar to those the user has interacted with.

2 - Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in, based on the characteristics of the items and the user's profile.

3 - Hybrid Methods: Combine collaborative and content-based approaches for more accurate and diverse recommendations.
